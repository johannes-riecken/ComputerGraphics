In order to compile these example you need following libraries installed:
- freeglut
- GLEW

In order to compile and run OpenCL examples you will also need OpenCL SDK
for your graphics card.

Freeglut can be downloaded from http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/.
GLEW can be downloaded from http://glew.sourceforge.net/.
For OpenCL SDK refer to the website of your graphics card manufacturer.

For Windows after installing required libraries write the paths to these
libraries into the file Makefile.nmake. It should look like shown below.

FREEGLUT      = f:/Libraries/freeglut
GLEW          = f:/Libraries/glew-1.9.0
OCL_INC_PATH  = "C:/Program Files (x86)/NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit/CUDA/v5.0/include/"
OCL_LIB_PATH  = "C:/Program Files (x86)/NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit/CUDA/v5.0/lib/Win32/"

For Linux you also need to install zlib, libjpeg and libpng.
After installing OpenCL SDK write path to it into the Makefile into OPENCLPATH.
It should like like is shown below.

OPENCLPATH = /usr/local/cuda-5.0/include/

To compile the examples for Windows open the Visual Studion command prompt, go
to the directory with example and type the following command:

	nmake -f Makefile.nmake

To compile the examples for Linux just issue the make command.
	make
